Yellowball Analysis Code
photometry_draw.py is the code that allows the user to draw a polygon over YBs and store photometry results; see the comments at the beginning of the code for the input files and paths that must be updated

photometry_auto.py does the photometry with only user radius as input

compact.py updates the compactness index for a data set that has completed photometry results stored in a csv file, including vertices for coordinates
